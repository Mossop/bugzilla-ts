# Bugzilla

Typesafe access to [Bugzilla's REST API](https://bugzilla.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api/index.html).

Very early work in progress, getting info from a bug or searching bugs is the main priority right
now.

No tests as yet. This is a quick and dirty implementation to support a side project I'm working on.
